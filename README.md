**Startup Guide**

This an UltimateModeration Bot designed specifically for MC servers but can be modified to work on anything.

1. Download the [repository](https://github.com/LebryantJohnson/ultimatebot) and get it into the desired location.
2. Make sure To have at least have node js 11.5.1 installed on your machine since this is a Discord Js 11 bot.
3. Edit the [config.yml](https://github.com/LebryantJohnson/ultimatebot/wiki/Config,yml) to your preference.
4. Start the bot with a daemon process like [PM2](https://pm2.keymetrics.io/)
